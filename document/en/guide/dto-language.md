# DTO Language

DTO Language is a generated language for DTO. It's used to generate DTO code. But, it depends on Java or Kotlin code, so it's hard to write DTO code in plain text.

JimmerBuddy provides a language extension for IntelliJ IDEA. It has the following features:

- Syntax highlight.
- Syntax check.
- Native compiler check.
- Code format.
- Code completion.

and more...
